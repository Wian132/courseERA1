    <h1>Strategy Game Tips</h1>
    <h2>Scanning</h2>
    <p>Scan around your town use your scout and find some gold,stone and relics , special sites if nearby , sea and mountains and most importantly , find your nearest enemy and ally. You have nothing yet but you will want the defenses and troops facing the nearest enemy and protecting your important buildings and villagers so your economy can keep going. This should not take more than a minute or 2 then you need to get going because the other players or AI are already ahead of you.</p>
    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <p>Focus on your economy from the get go , i try to initially get my labour divided 40:60 among wood/food in the first age , always have my town centers making workers ( i click them every few minutes to be sure the production is still going) I let 1 or 2 villagers onto a stone mine , and quickly try to get upto 4 villagers on the gold mines , as soon as food income allows for this. You want to get to the next age as soon as possible , i prefer bettering my economy in the first age and letting others advance past me (only 5 minutes or so) while my economy booms. As soon as you can build another town center do that so the economy grows twice as fast.</p>
    <h2>Military</h2>
    <p>As with everything you want some balance between depleting all your acquired resources and having the biggest and strongest army on the map.</p>
    <p>The biggest strategic rule is that you need a balanced army, you need some siege , but having 100 siege units likely costs too much for your economy and would not be powerful anyway.</p>
    <p>It's like a game of rock paper sciccors , horses kill archers easy , archers kill infantry easy and infantry kill horses easy.'</p>
    <p>Ofcourse with age of empires unlike other strategy games its very different and in age4 even more so than other AOE games , each civilization has different strengths.</p>

    <h2>Civilizations</h2>
    <p>This is the part that needs you to do some homework , civilizations each have their own strengths and research trees. Some civilizations (mongols) allows you to pack up your town center and other buildings to move around as needed.</p>
    <p>Different civilizations have different strenghts, knowing what these strengths are could be the difference between winning and losing.</p>
    <h2><a href="ResearchTrees.html"> Research Trees </a> </h2>
    <p>These tips are and continue to be a work in progress. I am also learning the game and improving the tips. These tips also are written based on how i like to play. I play for hours , i build big cities and strong defenses , i use expensive troops and alot of siege when i attack and need a strong economy to fuel this.</p>
